# **Technologies Used**

Within this assignment the technologies JavaScript and mySQL are used. 

JavaScript is utilized to create the prompts, connect to the databases, and insert the information received - from the prompts - into the database. 

MySQL is utilized to create the databases that houses all of the information of the employees, departments, and employee positions.  

# **Problems Faced**
 
 I struggled connecting the JavaScript to the databases. Other than that I did not experience too many issues when creating this application.
